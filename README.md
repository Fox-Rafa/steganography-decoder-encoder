# Steganography-decoder-encoder

This is my take on encoding/decoding data into images woth steganography. It encodes data into an image by changing the values of the top left pixels in a pattern that can be decoded later. You can encode data into an image or decode data from a image, you can use the hello-world.png image to test the decoder.

# How to run:

To use the encoder run the file steg1.py and follow the instructions
